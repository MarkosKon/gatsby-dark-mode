# Dark mode in React (Gatsby)

This repository contains the source code for the following post: https://markoskon.com/dark-mode-in-react/. The last two solutions are not mentioned in the post and they seem pretty good.

- **master**: Context, no local storage
- **context-local-storage-bug**: Context, save preferences in local storage with the bug in production.
- **posts**: An example of how React's hydrate treats differently attributes and text.
- **context-local-storage**: Context, save preferences in local storage (correct).
- **css**: Dan Abramov's solution from [overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io/)
- **css-refactor**: A refactor of the previous method.
- **css-refactor-hook**: The refactor with a `useTheme` hook (not linked in the post).
- **css-context-react-controls**: An example with context and a hook where React has the control (not linked in the post).
